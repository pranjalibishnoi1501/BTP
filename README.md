## BTP-1: Drought Prediction Using SPI and SPEI

The study explored the utility of two prominent drought prediction metrics:  
- **Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI)**  
- **Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)**  

Leveraging the capabilities of standard machine learning models such as:  
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**  

We aimed to harness the potential of these indices in forecasting flash droughts with a high degree of accuracy.

## BTP-2: Understanding Descartes' Rule of Signs for Hypersurfaces

This study focused on:  
1. Understanding the paper: **"On Generalizing Descartesâ€™ Rule of Signs to Hypersurfaces"** by Elisenda Feliu and Mate L. Telek.  
2. Developing geometric visualizations of the theorems presented in the paper.
